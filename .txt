Up next this : AI Assistance Context
Status: Not implemented
Purpose: Guided improvement, not content ownership


What this context is about
This context exists to augment the user’s thinking and presentation,
not to fabricate identity.
Key principle:
AI helps the user express what already exists more
clearly, more relevantly, and more ATS-friendly.
The AI:
·        Improves wording
·        Highlights gaps
·        Tailors structure to a job
It does not:
·        Invent experience
·        Store canonical CV data
·        Own the resume as a domain object
This keeps the system honest, auditable, and legally safer.


Core Design Philosophy
·        Stateless by default
·        Outputs are suggestions, not
facts
·        User remains the final authority


Aggregate Roots
None (by design)
There is no long-lived domain state that requires invariants.
AI outputs are:
·        Derived
·        Regeneratable
·        Non-authoritative


Entities & Value Objects
Entities (Ephemeral / Derived)
AIResumeSuggestion
Represents an AI-generated improvement to an existing CV section.
Examples:
·        Rewritten bullet point
·        Rephrased summary
·        Optimized skill grouping


Value Objects
ResumeSnapshot
·        A frozen view of the user’s CV at request time
·        Prevents AI from mutating live data

JobTarget
·        Extracted signals from a job description
·        Keywords, seniority, responsibilities

ATSOptimizationProfile
·        Formatting rules
·        Keyword density constraints
·        Verb/action consistency


Minimal Use Cases
Commands (AI generation actions)
·        ImproveResumeSection(ResumeId,
SectionType)

Rewrites content for clarity and impact without changing meaning.
·        TailorResumeForJob(ResumeId, JobId)

Adjusts wording and emphasis to match a specific job description in an
ATS-friendly way.
·        ExtractJobRequirements(JobId)

Identifies implicit expectations, tools, and skills not explicitly listed.
·        SuggestSkillGaps(ResumeId, JobId)

Highlights missing or underrepresented skills relative to the job.


Queries (Read-only, safe retrieval)
·        GetLastAISuggestions(UserId)

Fetches the most recent suggestions for review.
·        PreviewTailoredResume(ResumeId, JobId)

Returns a non-persisted preview of how the CV would look when tailored.


Key Invariants & Constraints
·        AI output must be traceable to source input
·        No AI output is auto-applied
·        Suggestions expire and can be regenerated
·        AI cannot introduce experience not present in
the resume-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOW READ !!!! : ---> It seems like there are no aggregates for this as shown here , and there are very little value objects -- also there was an Entity suggested --- Now what i want to know if if there is anything to be persisted in this context. If there is anything that requires a table for this context for the purpose of persistence , then indicate it , create the table ( add to the prisma schema) and if we will need to create its entity equivalent for protecting any invariants --Note this is strict ! if we do not need to persist anything , then there is no need for a repo port and implementation - therefore we reduce time spent on this context - Also we shall be using a port for the AI adapter , so look through the usecases and define an SOLID interface/port  that any AI implementation adapter must follow -- We shall touch more on the AI adapter soon ( i have a special feature i need us to create there , but ill save it for later ) Also take note of the usecases and spilt them into commands and queries -----DO THIS AS ACUURATELY AS POSSIBLE
